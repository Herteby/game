{-| Make a shape **horizontally** bigger or smaller.
Also can be used to flip object:

    tile 20 27 0 "character.png" 1
        |> scaleX -1

scaleX : Number -> Shape -> Shape
scaleX sx (Shape shape) =
    Shape { shape | sx = shape.sx * sx }


{-| Make a shape **vertically** bigger or smaller.

    Shape { shape | sy = shape.sy * sy }


{-| Show tile from a tileset.

All tiles are fixed size and placed into a grid, where the first tile has a **0** index
increasing left to right and top to bottom.

Example: having a 3x3 tileset with each tile of 16x24 pixels

    | 0 1 2 |
    | 3 4 5 |
    | 6 7 8 |

this draws the first tile of the second row

    tile 16 24 "sprites.png" 3

    useTexture tileset <|
        \t ->
            custom tileW tileH <| Render.tile t (vec2 tileW tileH) (size t) (toFloat index)


{-| Show sprite from a sprite sheet.

Sprites can be placed anywhere in the atlas and each can have different sizes.

Example: this draws a sprite of 16x24 pixels taking it from a sprite sheet,
starting at position `16,0` up to _including_ pixels at `31,23`

    sprite "sprites.png" { xmin = 16, xmax = 31, ymin = 0, ymax = 23 }

-}
sprite : String -> { xmin : Number, xmax : Number, ymin : Number, ymax : Number } -> Shape
sprite atlas { xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax } =
    let
        w =
            abs (xmax - xmin) + 1

        h =
            abs (ymax - ymin) + 1
    in
    useTexture atlas <|
        \t ->
            let
                ( tW_, tH_ ) =
                    WebGL.Texture.size t

                tW =
                    toFloat tW_

                tH =
                    toFloat tH_

                uv =
                    vec4 (xmin / tW) (1 - ymin / tH - (h / tH)) (w / tW) (h / tH)
            in
            custom w h <| Render.sprite t (vec2 tW tH) uv


colorTile : Number -> Number -> String -> Color -> Int -> Shape
colorTile tileW tileH tileset color index =
    useTexture tileset <|
        \t ->
            custom tileW tileH <| Render.tileWithColor t (vec2 tileW tileH) (size t) color (toFloat index)


{-| Show tilemap from a tileset and a corresponding lookup table stored as a texture.

Example: this lookup table is used to draw a T-shaped platform

    | 2 2 2 |
    | 0 1 0 |
    | 0 1 0 |

which in turn uses this 3x3 tileset with each tile 16x24px

    | 1 2 3 |
    | 4 5 6 |
    | 7 8 9 |

**Note:** tileset indexing starts from **1** when used in lookup table

    tilemap 16 24 "sprites.png" "lookuptable.png"


## Why

For tiny maps `tile` function is enough. However, when the game map grows in size performance issues creep in.
The underlying issue is that for each `tile` the WebGL rendering engine uses what is called an [Entity][1].
WebGL can handle a few thousands of such entities thus having a map with 100x100 tiles means to draw 10.000
entities for each frame - that’s way too much for WebGL.


## How it works

To avoid performance issues the idea is to draw a single WebGL `Entity` for each `tilemap` call by pushing
the composition of the map down the rendering pipeline.

To do that we need to pass to playground both the tileset and a 2D array of tile indices. The latter will
be used to look-up the correct tile.

You can visualize the lookup table like those mini-maps you see on video games HUD. Each lookup table pixel
represents a tile in the final tilemap, while the color _value_ of that pixel is an index telling which tile
to pick from the tileset.

All tiles are fixed size and placed into a grid, with indices increasing left to right and top to bottom. Notice
that a fully black but transparent pixel (`0x00000000`) means "no tile here" and nothing is rendered.
Unlike `tile`, this makes the lookup table indices to start from **1**.

More details about this rendering technique can be found in [Brandon Jones’ blog][2].
